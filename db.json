Entrepreneurs harness technological advances and, with skill and luck, turn them into profitable products. Technology, in turn, changes how firms operate: electricity enabled the creation of larger, more efficient factories, since these no longer needed to depend on a central source of steam power; email has done away with most letters. But new technologies also affect business in a subtler, more profound way. They alter not just how companies do things but also what they do—and, critically, what they don’t do.</p><p>The history of capitalism is a story of such reorganisations. The Industrial Revolution put paid to the “putting-out system”, in which companies obtained raw materials but outsourced manufacturing to self-employed craftsmen who converted these into finished products at home and were paid by output. Instead, factories strengthened the tie between worker, now employed directly and paid by the hour, and workplace. The telegraph, telephone and, in the 20th century, containerised shipping and better information technology (IT), have allowed multinational companies to subcontract ever more tasks to ever more places. China became the world’s factory; India became its back office. Nearly three years after the pandemic began, it is clear that technology is once again profoundly redrawing the boundaries of the firm.</p><p>In the rich world, fast broadband internet and new communication platforms like Zoom or Microsoft Teams mean that a third of working days are now done remotely. Jobs are trickling out from corporate headquarters in metropolises to smaller cities and towns. And the boundary between collaborating with a colleague, a freelance worker or another firm is blurring. Companies are drawing on common pools of resources, from cloud computing to human capital. By one estimate, skilled freelance workers in America earned $247bn in 2021, up from about $135bn in 2018. The biggest firms in America and Europe are becoming more reliant on outsourcing white-collar work. Exports of commercial services from six large emerging markets have grown by 16.5% a year since the pandemic began, up from 6.5% before it (see chart 1). On January 9th Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), an Indian IT-outsourcing giant, is expected to report another bump in profits.</p><p>On Coase inspection</p><p>A useful lens for understanding these changes was offered by Ronald Coase in his ground-breaking paper from 1937 entitled “The nature of the firm”. Stay small and you forgo the efficiency afforded by scale. Grow too big and a business is too unwieldy to manage—think of Soviet-style command-and-control economies. Most commerce happens in between those extremes. But where on the continuum? Coase, whose insights earned him a Nobel prize in economics, argued that firms’ boundaries—in other words, what to do and what not to do yourself—are determined by how transaction and information costs differ within firms and between them. Some things are done most efficiently in house. The market takes care of the rest.</p><p>For example, between the 1980s and the 2010s, globalisation and the IT boom boosted economies of scale and, as a result, encouraged market concentration. But the two factors also increased competitive pressures and reduced the cost of communication and collaboration between firms. This caused companies to shrink their scopes. In research published last year Lorenz Ekerdt and Kai-Jie Wu of the University of Rochester found that the average number of sectors in which American manufacturers were active fell by half between 1977 and 2017. By the 2000s many sprawling industrial conglomerates like Germany’s Degussa, which had a hand in everything from metals to medicine, or British Aerospace, which was dabbling in automobiles, had unwound themselves and picked the knitting to stick to (chemicals and aircraft, respectively).</p><p>Today Coasean forces are ushering in a new type of corporate organisation. It resembles a 21st-century putting-out system—not for artisan craftsmen but for the sort of white-collar professionals who epitomise modern Western economies. Micha Kaufman, boss of Fiverr, an Israel-based marketplace which matches freelance workers with corporate clients around the world, observes that firms are getting better at measuring workers’ performance based on their actual output rather than time spent producing it. This is true both of employees and subcontractors. The result is a reorganisation of businesses both internally and in relation to other companies in the economy.</p><p>Start on the inside. Using data from America’s Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, The Economist has examined jobs in three sectors particularly compatible with remote work: technology, finance and professional services. Our analysis finds that such jobs have become far more distributed across America since the pandemic. Big metropolitan areas have lost out to smaller cities and even the countryside (see chart 2). Since the fourth quarter of 2019, the number of jobs in the three sectors has grown by five percentage points more in rural areas than in San Francisco and New York.</p><p>Firms are also distributing work across more borders, often in new ways. Oswald Yeo, who runs Glints, a recruiting startup in Singapore, says that his firm hires employees in batches by country. That helps the new recruits from Indonesia, say, form in-person connections with colleagues there, while expanding Glints’s talent pool, Mr Yeo explains. There is a premium for locations without a big time difference because, as a study last year from Harvard Business School found, cross-border teams collaborating on non-routine tasks often work into their leisure time in order to work synchronously with colleagues in different time zones. In Glints’s case, that is places like Indonesia.</p><p>For American companies, it is increasingly Canada. Microsoft, which opened its first Canadian office in 1985, created a big new one in Toronto in 2022. Google is tripling its Canadian workforce to 5,000. A study last year by CBRE, a property firm, of the 50 cities in America and Canada with the most tech workers found that four of the top ten were Canadian. Together, the four added 180,000 tech jobs between 2016 and 2021, an increase of 39%. By comparison, the top four American cities gained just 86,000 jobs, or 8%, over the same period. Lower costs doubtless helped; the Canadian quartet were among the 16 cheapest cities among the 50, as measured by housing costs.</p><p>Barriers to immigration are another factor forcing firms to look abroad, says Prithwiraj Choudhury of Harvard Business School. Mr Choudhury has documented a growing class of firms that help employers forge stable relationships with overseas employees without hiring them directly. One example is MobSquad, a firm that recruits skilled workers unable to obtain visas to America and employs them in Canada instead. Its American clients include Betterment, an investment firm, and Guardant Health, a biotechnology company.</p><p>MobSquad’s recruits sit somewhere in between outsourced temps and full-time employees. This sort of arrangement points to the bigger Coasean shift—to how firms demarcate which tasks they perform on their own account and which they subcontract.</p><p>A survey of nearly 500 American firms conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta in August 2022 found that 18% plan to use more independent contractors; only 2% said they would use fewer (see chart 3). On top of that, 13% want to rely more on leased workers, compared with 1% who want to reduce this reliance. MBO Partners, a workforce-management firm, estimates that the number of American workers engaging in independent work for at least 15 hours a week increased from 15m in 2019 to 22m in 2022. Official figures from the Bureau of Labour Statistics are more conservative, but still show that nearly 1m more Americans are self-employed than at the start of 2020. Pandemic-era job losses forcing people into less desirable work arrangements cannot be the whole story; a similar surge in self-employment did not occur after the global financial crisis of 2007-09.</p><p>The shift is once again enabled by technology, such as the proliferation of platforms for all manner of freelance work. Having grown slowly, from 9% of America’s labour force in 2000 to 11% in 2018, self-employment is becoming much more common. Gig work is no longer the preserve of ride-hailing or food delivery. Whereas earlier freelance platforms, such as Taskrabbit, focused on routine tasks, emerging new ones increasingly recruit freelance workers for complicated work. Upwork specialises in web development; Fiverr is known for media production. Amazon turned to Tongal, another freelancing platform, when it needed a team to rapidly produce social-media content for its Prime TV shows.</p><p>Besides making it easier for companies to rely on non-employees, technology is enabling new ways of collaboration between businesses. In 2020 Slack, the messaging platform of choice at many a firm, launched a feature that allows users to communicate directly with other companies as they can within their own organisations. More than 70% of companies in the Fortune 100 list of America’s biggest firms by revenue use the feature. The Atlanta Fed’s survey found that 16% of responding firms were planning to increase domestic outsourcing and 12% envisioned more offshoring. Already, combined revenues for six big IT-services firms with large operations in India—Cognizant, HCLT, Infosys, TCS, Tech Mahindra and Wipro—grew by 25% between the third quarter of 2019 and the same period last year (see chart 4).</p><p>Pinning down just how much firms depend on outsiders is tricky—companies do not advertise this sort of thing. To get an idea, Katie Moon and Gordon Phillips, two economists, look at a firm’s external purchase commitments in the upcoming year as a share of its cost of sales. As a snapshot of the economy, this measure of “outsourcing intensity”, as Ms Moon and Mr Phillips call it, must be treated with caution; it does not capture all types of outsourcing and different firms account for external purchases in different ways. But it usefully illustrates changes over time.</p><p>The Economist has calculated the measure using data from financial reports for a sample of large listed firms from America and Europe (see chart 5). We find that companies are indeed growing more reliant on others. Average outsourcing intensity across our sample has nearly doubled from 11% in 2005 to 22% in the most recent year of data (either 2021 or 2022). This growth is especially pronounced among tech titans such as Apple and Microsoft; businesses that grew little over the analysed period, such as Unilever, a British consumer-goods giant, saw only small increases. This is consistent with research which finds that as firms grow ever larger and adopt more technologies, thus becoming more complex and unwieldy, they outsource more operations—precisely as Coase would have predicted.</p><p>As technology evolves, the contours of the firm will continue to be redrawn. The result is that companies have greater flexibility to seek out new workers for new tasks in new places. Portugal has created a special visa for digital nomads, who will be able to work from the country for a year. Argentina wants to introduce a preferential exchange rate for freelance workers selling their services abroad: the “tech dollar” would ensure that they will not be exposed to the rapidly devaluing peso.</p><p>For Western white-collar types, this stiffer competition for work may translate into compressed wages. According to a working paper published last year, by Alberto Cavallo of Harvard Business School and colleagues, wages differ less between countries for occupations that are more prone to outsourcing. For the global economy, though, it means greater efficiency and, hopefully, faster growth and higher living standards. And for Coase, it means continued relevance. ■</p><p>More from Business</p><p>A scandal rocks India’s pharmaceutical industry</p><p>Can the world’s pharmacy escape a reputation for poor quality control?</p><p>How to avoid flight chaos</p><p>Lessons from Southwest and Volaris, two highly successful airlines that ruined the holidays</p><p>Investors conclude that Tesla is a carmaker, not a tech firm</p><p>A share-price rout suggests they no longer think it will take over the world</p>", "date_searched": "2023-01-08T22:46:10.630Z", "article_searched_by": "url", "article_published_date": "", "article_author": "", "searcher": 1, "article_by_url_stars": [], "article_by_url_bookmarks": [], "article_by_url_flags": []}}, {"model": "news.articlebyurl", "pk": 2, "fields": {"URL": "https://www.economist.com/business/2023/01/04/investors-conclude-that-tesla-is-a-carmaker-not-a-tech-firm", "title": "Investors conclude that Tesla is a carmaker, not a tech firm | The Economist", "article_source": "The Economist", "page_title": "Investors conclude that Tesla is a carmaker, not a tech firm | The Economist", "article_description": "-", "domain_source": "www.economist.com", "domain_full": "https://www.economist.com", "text": "<p>A share-price rout suggests they no longer think it will take over the world</p><p>After Tesla’s market capitalisation swept past that of Toyota, then the world’s most valuable car company, in the summer of 2020, devoted fans and incredulous sceptics deployed a new unit of measurement. As the electric-vehicle (EV) champion’s share price rose, its worth was couched in terms of the combined value of the next two, then five, then ten biggest carmakers. A year ago Tesla’s market value surpassed $1.2trn, more than most other car companies put together. Since then it has lost 71% of that—a sum exceeding the value of most of the industry. The fortune of its mercurial boss, Elon Musk, has shrivelled by more than $200bn as a result.</p><p>The latest blow came on January 3rd, after Tesla missed analysts’ expectations for deliveries for the third quarter in a row and reported that the gap between production and deliveries had grown, suggesting softening demand for its EVs. It lost 12% of its value—roughly $50bn, or one Ford Motor Company—in a day. Even bullish investors now doubt that Mr Musk will fulfil his promise of making 20m cars a year by 2030, or that Tesla’s ”Autopilot” is close to becoming a world-changing fully autonomous driving system. Yet the main reason for the market’s recalibration of Tesla’s prospects is a dawning realisation that the company is chiefly a carmaker—and that its boss is not superhuman.</p><p>Mr Musk has always regarded his company as a tech firm, a peer of digital giants like Alphabet, Apple or Meta, not of old-economy metal-bashers such as Toyota or Volkswagen. For a time, so did the market—first as tech shares soared amid the pandemic-era boom in all things digital, then as they slumped last year, after their growth began to slow and higher interest rates made their promised future profits look less valuable today.</p><p>In the past few months, however, Tesla’s share price has suffered a sharper correction than big tech. This has coincided with its more mundane tribulations as a car business. Having managed to avoid the worst of the pandemic supply-chain disruptions, Tesla has been caught up in China’s chaotic retreat from the zero-covid policy; its big factory in Shanghai has been hit by virus-related shutdowns. And having set the course for the industry’s EV transition, it now faces plenty of competition from established rivals and a host of newcomers it inspired. Days after Tesla reported the disappointing figures, Volkswagen unveiled its id.7, a challenger to Tesla’s entry-level Model 3 saloon.</p><p>EV-buyers, for their part, are becoming less willing than early adopters to overlook Tesla’s questionable build quality and the interior of a much cheaper car. And the natural Tesla-owners among the wealthy progressive set are less prepared to overlook Mr Musk’s libertarian antics at Twitter, which he bought in October and has mismanaged with gusto—especially now that they have plenty of conscience-salving EV alternatives to choose from.</p><p>Tesla is, in other words, no longer the only game in town—and certainly no tech behemoth. As EV-makers go, though, it still looks impressive. In 2022 it delivered 1.3m cars, 40% more than the year before, and opened two new assembly plants. It is working on a smaller, cheaper car and this year will start to deliver its long-awaited Cybertruck pick-up. And it is still worth some $360bn—about as much as the next three biggest carmakers combined. ■</p><p>To stay on top of the biggest stories in business and technology, sign up to the Bottom Line, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter.</p><p>This article appeared in the Business section of the print edition under the headline \"The Tesla conundrum\"</p><p>Business January 7th 2023</p><p>Can the North Sea become Europe’s new economic powerhouse?</p><p>How to have the most productive working day of your life</p><p>A scandal rocks India’s pharmaceutical industry</p><p>Investors conclude that Tesla is a carmaker, not a tech firm</p><p>How to avoid flight chaos</p><p>From the January 7th 2023 edition</p><p>Discover stories from this section and more in the list of contents</p><p>More from Business</p><p>How technology is redrawing the boundaries of the firm</p><p>Companies are reorganising themselves in the wake of digital upheaval</p><p>Can the world’s pharmacy escape a reputation for poor quality control?</p><p>Lessons from Southwest and Volaris, two highly successful airlines that ruined the holidays</p>", "date_searched": "2023-01-08T22:47:11.261Z", "article_searched_by": "url", "article_published_date": "", "article_author": "", "searcher": 1, "article_by_url_stars": [], "article_by_url_bookmarks": [], "article_by_url_flags": []}}, {"model": "news.articlebyurl", "pk": 3, "fields": {"URL": "https://www.economist.com/business/2023/01/04/investors-conclude-that-tesla-is-a-carmaker-not-a-tech-firm", "title": "-", "article_source": "-", "page_title": "-", "article_description": "-", "domain_source": "-", "domain_full": "-", "text": "-", "date_searched": "2023-01-08T22:47:11.774Z", "article_searched_by": "url", "article_published_date": "", "article_author": "", "searcher": 1, "article_by_url_stars": [], "article_by_url_bookmarks": [], "article_by_url_flags": []}}, {"model": "news.articlebyurl", "pk": 4, "fields": {"URL": "https://www.economist.com/business/2023/01/05/a-scandal-rocks-indias-pharmaceutical-industry", "title": "A scandal rocks India’s pharmaceutical industry | The Economist", "article_source": "The Economist", "page_title": "A scandal rocks India’s pharmaceutical industry | The Economist", "article_description": "-", "domain_source": "www.economist.com", "domain_full": "https://www.economist.com", "text": "<p>Can the world’s pharmacy escape a reputation for poor quality control?</p><p>It is the stuff of parental nightmares. Between July and October 70 children in Gambia died of kidney failure. In December 18 perished in Uzbekistan from renal problems and acute respiratory disease. In both cases Indian-made cough syrups may have been at fault, according to allegations by a Gambian parliamentary committee and the Uzbek authorities.</p><p>The manufacturer in the Uzbek case, Marion Biotech, has been suspended from Pharmexcil, an Indian government-linked trade group that plays a role in pharmaceutical exports; the firm’s website appears to be down. An executive for Maiden Pharma, which produced the medicine used in Gambia, told an Indian newspaper that the company was shocked and saddened by the deaths. The firm posted a report on its Facebook page claiming that a government drug-testing lab in India had found its syrup to be problem-free; unpersuaded Gambian parliamentarians recommended that Maiden should be prosecuted. Neither firm responded to The Economist’s requests for comment.</p><p>Both companies are small and privately held. A causal link between their products and the deaths has not been proved. Sample tests in India have so far cleared Maiden of blame; an investigation of Marion has just begun. Yet the incidents have touched a raw nerve in India’s vast pharmaceutical industry, where around 10,000 factories operated by 3,000 firms churn out nearly $50bn-worth of drugs a year, accounting for 20% of the world’s and 40% of America’s generics supply by value.</p><p>The world’s pharmacy, as India’s drugmakers like to call themselves, is no stranger to scandal. In 2022 America’s Food and Drug Administration issued “import alerts” to four large Indian companies. Such notifications, which usually follow inspections of foreign factories, could lead to exports to America being blocked without physical evidence that a particular shipment is bad.</p><p>Concerns about corner-cutting and poor quality control are the long-standing flip-side of the rock-bottom prices that have fuelled the industry’s rise in India in the past few decades. In a new book, “The Truth Pill: The Myth of Drug Regulation in India”, Dinesh Singh Thakur, a former industry executive, and Prashant Reddy, a lawyer, document at least five cases of dangerous medications entering the market, each causing multiple fatalities, since the 1970s. In many more instances shabby manufacturing methods could lead to medicines that are ineffective. These shortcomings are obscured by a complex and opaque inspection regime, says Mr Reddy. Concerns aired by critics like him and Mr Thakur are often ignored—or met with threatening legal notices from the government for supposedly tarnishing the domestic industry’s reputation.</p><p>The government’s initial response to the latest tragedies has been lethargic and has lacked a detailed public examination of the relevant supply chains, says Mr Reddy. History offers little hope of a swift conclusion. One case in Mumbai, which involved the deaths of 14 people in a big hospital in 1988, is still being litigated. Such foot-dragging risks the lives of more patients. It also ultimately harms India’s drugmakers, whose health is inextricably bound up with that of their customers. ■</p><p>To stay on top of the biggest stories in business and technology, sign up to the Bottom Line, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter.</p><p>This article appeared in the Business section of the print edition under the headline \"A bitter syrup\"</p><p>Business January 7th 2023</p><p>Can the North Sea become Europe’s new economic powerhouse?</p><p>How to have the most productive working day of your life</p><p>A scandal rocks India’s pharmaceutical industry</p><p>Investors conclude that Tesla is a carmaker, not a tech firm</p><p>How to avoid flight chaos</p><p>From the January 7th 2023 edition</p><p>Discover stories from this section and more in the list of contents</p><p>More from Business</p><p>How technology is redrawing the boundaries of the firm</p><p>Companies are reorganising themselves in the wake of digital upheaval</p><p>Lessons from Southwest and Volaris, two highly successful airlines that ruined the holidays</p><p>A share-price rout suggests they no longer think it will take over the world</p>", "date_searched": "2023-01-08T22:47:34.452Z", "article_searched_by": "url", "article_published_date": "", "article_author": "", "searcher": 1, "article_by_url_stars": [], "article_by_url_bookmarks": [], "article_by_url_flags": []}}, {"model": "news.articlebyurl", "pk": 5, "fields": {"URL": "https://www.economist.com/the-world-this-week/2023/01/05/politics-and-business", "title": "Politics and business | The Economist", "article_source": "The Economist", "page_title": "Politics and business | The Economist", "article_description": "-", "domain_source": "www.economist.com", "domain_full": "https://www.economist.com", "text": "<p>After nearly three years of self-imposed isolation, China said it would reopen its borders on January 8th.

Microsoft (NASDAQ:</span><span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper paywall-full-content invisible\">NASDAQ:<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT\" title=\"Microsoft Corporation\">MSFT</a></span><span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">) gaming head Phil Spencer, as reported by </span><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/18/22789881/microsoft-xbox-boss-phil-spencer-deeply-troubled-by-activision-blizzard-bobby-kotick\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><em>The Verge</em></a><span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> on November 18, 2021, was âevaluating all aspectsâ of their Activision relationship and, âdeeply troubled by the horrific events and actionsâ that took place at the company. Activision was embroiled in allegations that the firm cultivated a culture of constant sexual harassment, and more shockingly, that the cultural rot extended all the way to Founder / CEO Bobby Kotick. Phil Spencer had previously publicly pledged to combat the toxicity in gaming culture and the possibility of one Activisionâs largest partners altering their business relationship catalyzed an incremental 10% share price drop over the following week ending December 10, 2021, to $58. Reality, as revealed by </span><a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/718877/000110465922036155/tm225196-4_defm14a.htm#tBOTM\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">regulatory filings</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">, couldnât have been further from the media speculation. Less than 24 hours after the ominous </span><em class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Verge</em><span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> article, Phil Spencer had a telephone conversation with Activision Founder and CEO, Bobby Kotick, where he expressed Microsoftâs interest in purchasing the entirety of Activision at a premium. Two months later the largest deal in the history of not only gaming, but all of technology, was signed confirming Microsoftâs all cash offer of $95 per share, or $69 billion.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The transaction will cement Microsoftâs position as the third largest gaming company globally by revenues (behind Tencent and Sony), with exposure throughout the value-chain, strength in mobile and possibly the best intellectual property suite in the industry. Activision shares popped 26% on the January 18<sup>th</sup>, announcement to $82 and have since gradually deflated to the mid $70s.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">At the current share price of $76.88, a 24% percent arbitrage opportunity exists with the deal expected to close by the end of June, 2023. The current market price only ascribes a 51% probability that the deal closes at the original terms set out in the merger agreement. The oversized spread is driven by a combination of the market overestimating the competency of Bidenâs antitrust team, dismissing the horizontal competitive landscape in gaming and forgetting that Microsoft has never failed to acquire a target in its corporate history. It doesnât hurt that Warren Buffett, who started his career in merger arbitrage, purchased <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/30/buffett-berkshire-owns-9point5percent-of-activision-blizzard-shares-in-merger-arbitrage-bet.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">9.5% of Activision stock</a>. Per my analysis, a more realistic probability that the deal closes is 80%, which would imply a share price of $86.50 (12.5% above todayâs prices).</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Reaction to The Deal and the Evolution of Antitrust Enforcement</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">On March 31, 2022, Senators Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Sheldon Whitehouse and Cory Booker penned a <a href=\"https://www.warren.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/2022.03.31%20Letter%20to%20FTC%20re%20Activision%20Microsoft%20Deal.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">joint letter</a> to Federal Trade Commission Chairwoman Lina Khan excoriating Activisionâs âfrat boy cultureâ and Microsoftâs anti-union history as undermining the rights and dignity of workers. The Senators urged the FTC to oppose the deal on the grounds it will have an anticompetitive impact on labor. These contentions are a logical stretch and attribute powers to the FTC outside the established purview of antitrust law. Lina Khan issued an <a href=\"https://www.warren.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Response%20Letter%20to%20FTC%20Chair%20Lina%20M.%20Khan%20to%20Sen.%20Warren%20re%20Microsoft%20Activision.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">official response</a> on June 9, 2022 to qualm the Senatorsâ concerns and confirm that the agency was scrutinizing the deal.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The Senatorsâ objections are purposefully outside the established purview of antitrust legislation because the current crop of regulators passionately believe that purview should be expanded. Jonathan Kanter, current Assistant Attorney General of the United States, expressed the <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/assistant-attorney-general-jonathan-kanter-delivers-keynote-speech-georgetown-antitrust\" rel=\"nofollow\">view</a> during his keynote at the Georgetown Antitrust Law symposium in September, 2022,</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><p>On the other hand, merger enforcement has become disconnected from the competitive realities of our economy. It has become a sometimes-artificial exercise. We focus too much on a small handful of models for predicting price effects, and lose sight of the competition actually at stake. We obsess in all cases about market definition, when in many situations direct evidence can help us assess the potential for harm. Competition varies, and our framework must adapt accordingly<em>.</em></p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Kanter doesnât want to be constrained by sets of arduous formulas and tricky market definitions. He longs for a world where he can unilaterally apply his well informed judgement to merger transactions and block future wrongs from being inflicted upon society. His vision for antitrust enforcement is shared by media darling Lina Khan, a known critic of big tech, who came to prominence at Yale Law by writing a paper describing how modern antitrust law failed to check Amazonâs growing and predatory power. Despite the grandiose pronouncements and countless FDR references, the Khan / Kanter model of antitrust enforcement is failing to produce practical results in the form of case wins and legal precedents.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Recent Court Losses </strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Despite the headlines heralding the new antitrust sheriff in town, little progress has been made on regulating big tech and the United States regulatory agencies have suffered stinging court defeats. Historically, the government only challenged transactions that were certain wins at trial, but regulatory action has become more adventurous of late. The Federal Trade Commissionâs own in-house judge determined that Illumina Inc.âs (NASDAQ:<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ILMN\" title=\"Illumina, Inc.\">ILMN</a>) $7 billion <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-09-02/ftc-to-appeal-illumina-grail-merger-loss-extending-litigation\" rel=\"nofollow\">acquisition</a> of early stage cancer firm Grail Inc. was not in violation of antitrust law despite the FTC challenge. The <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2022/02/administrative-law-judge-dismisses-ftc-antitrust-complaint-against-altria-group-juul-labs-inc\" rel=\"nofollow\">FTC</a> also had its challenge to the Altria (NYSE:<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MO\" title=\"Altria Group, Inc.\">MO</a>) / JUUL Labs (big tobacco buying e-cigarette firm) partial acquisition dismissed by an administrative law judge. Most surprisingly, Kanter and the DOJ were defeated in their first merger challenge by Latham Watkins after attempting to block <a href=\"https://www.lw.com/en/news/2022/09/latham-defeats-doj-challenge-to-us-sugar-acquisition-imperial-sugar\" rel=\"nofollow\">U.S. Sugarâs</a> acquisition of Imperial Sugar. If the U.S. regulators are not competent enough to block transactions in clearly concentrated industries like tobacco and sugar, Iâm not inspired by their ability to curtail one of corporate Americaâs most capable companies, Microsoft.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Horizontal Landscape </strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">From the perspective of Kanterâs much maligned formulas, the Microsoft / Activision transaction doesnât appear to be overly anticompetitive. The commonly used <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/atr/herfindahl-hirschman-index\" rel=\"nofollow\">Herfindalh-Hirschman Index (HHI)</a> is calculated by squaring and summing all of the market shares of industry participants and comparing the totals ex-ante and ex-post. In a pure, single firm monopoly the HHI would equal 10,000, 5,000 in a pure duopoly, 3,333 in a three firm oligopoly and so on. A HHI between 1,500 â 2,500 is considered moderately concentrated and a value above 2,500 is highly concentrated. Per the <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/atr/horizontal-merger-guidelines-08192010#5c\" rel=\"nofollow\">FTC horizontal merger guidelines</a>, a merger that increases industry concentration by 200 points or more in a highly concentrated market should raise antitrust concerns. The video game industry is highly fragmented with a HHI of 860. The largest player is <a href=\"https://newzoo.com/insights/rankings/top-25-companies-game-revenues\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tencent</a> with under 20% of the market. After the Activision acquisition, Microsoft would still be smaller than both Tencent and Sony and the HHI would only increase to ~940, representing an 80 point increase in an industry well below moderately concentrated.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>UK / EU Regulatory Perspective </strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/634536048fa8f5153767e533/MSFT.ABK_phase_1_decision_-_1.09.2022.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">UK</a> and European regulators are analyzing the deal through a less orthodox methodology; attempting to forecast where the gaming industry is headed and how the Microsoft / Activision transaction affects that hypothetical competitive landscape. The gaming industry is in a transitional phase, from console-focused buy-to-play arrangements towards cloud gaming and multi-game subscription services. Cloud gaming allows titles to be enjoyed on cheaper, less computationally intensive devices like tablets or mobile phones and many new entrants are competing for gamers, including Amazon Luna, Google Stadia, NVIDIA GeForce, Blacknut and Netflix. Industry experts speculate that the future of gaming will revolve around a strong content catalog, cloud infrastructure and operating system licenses; therefore, Microsoft equipped with Activisionâs IP, its Azure cloud computing and Windows OS, could secure a stranglehold over the nascent industry before it even has a chance to develop.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Regulators have raised concerns regarding Microsoftâs market position and incentive to withhold its valuable intellectual property from other console providers like Sony and Nintendo. This fear is well-founded as Microsoft has publicly considered making future game releases from recently acquired studios exclusive to Xbox, most notably Elder Scrolls VI from Bethesda. The UKâs Competition and Markets Authority seems myopically focused on the Call of Duty franchise and its possible impact on Sonyâs PlayStation ecosystem. These concerns appear to be overly influenced by Sonyâs complaints, and despite Phil Spencer already offering to extend the Call of Duty PlayStation license for 10 years beyond their current agreement, Sony remains unsatisfied. Over 40% of the Call of Duty community exists on PlayStation and I doubt Microsoft wants to alienate a large part of their new gamer-base. Additionally, Microsoftâs gaming strategy explicitly aims to reach gamers regardless of their device. <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2022/10/06/brazil-approves-microsoft-activision-acquisition-says-it-doesnt-need-to-protect-playstation/?sh=74de07144381\" rel=\"nofollow\">Brazilâs</a> competition regulator recently approved the deal and seemed to not pay much attention to Sonyâs complaints, stating the decision was made for Brazilian consumers and ânot the defense of particular interests of specific competitorsâ. The UK Phase II review period has a March 1, 2023, deadline.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">In Brussels, the European Commission announced an in-depth <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_22_6578\" rel=\"nofollow\">investigation</a> into the proposed acquisition on November 8<sup>th</sup>, 2022. The EU raised similar issues as the UK, but also added that the deal may lessen the competition in PC operating systems. There is a March 23, 2023, deadline for a decision.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Is it sensible to take regulatory action today about a fictional future? Do UK or EU regulatory bodies even have the ability to accurately forecast the future of gaming? It appears that UK regulators are once again demonstrating their elevated sense of self importance (Activision only derives $70 million in revenues from the United Kingdom). I expect Microsoft to be capable of satisfying most regulatory bodies with remedial concessions, which could include formal agreements with competitors to not make Call of Duty exclusive.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Industry Reaction</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Outside of Sony, other industry players seem to assume that the merger will be completed and are not particular bothered by the tie-up. Take-Two Interactive <a href=\"https://www.vgchartz.com/article/455414/take-two-ceo-has-no-concerns-over-microsofts-activision-blizzard-acquisition/\" rel=\"nofollow\">CEO Strauss Zelnick</a> recently commented that he has no issues with the deal and most other competitors feel similarly. Considering the anticompetitive effects of the transaction, Zelnick made his view clear, âWe donât really think the competitive landscape is meaningfully affected in the event that the merger goes through.â</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>FTC Lawsuit </strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">On December 8, 2022, the US Federal Trade Commission voted 3-1 in favor of suing to block the deal. Interestingly, the share price didn't move much (+/-1%) on the news. The <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/D09412MicrosoftActivisionAdministrativeComplaintPublicVersionFinal.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">complaint</a>, borrows from the concerns shared by the UK and EU regulators, namely the risk that Microsoft will withhold content from rival console manufacturers. âSonyâ was mentioned 20 times and âNintendoâ 26 times in the 23 page complaint. The complaint fails to mention that Microsoft and <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/07/microsoft-says-it-will-bring-call-of-duty-to-nintendo-for-10-years.html#:~:text=%22Microsoft%20and%20Nintendo%20have%20entered,however%20they%20choose%20to%20play.%22\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nintendo</a> have already reached an agreement to allow Call of Duty on Nintendo devices for 10 years past their current license. The first pre-trial hearing occurred on January, 3, 2023. Bidenâs antitrust team is spread thin and will struggle to convince a judge in the face of Microsoftâs generous concessions.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Risks &amp; Conclusion </strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Despite requiring regulatory approval in several jurisdictions including the United States, European Union, United Kingdom, Australia, Brazil and South Korea, potential action by Microsoft represents a greater threat to the arbitrage. Activision has been missing the guidance provided in its merger agreement by a wide margin and the last three quarters saw revenue growth of -22%, -28% and 14% respectively. Microsoft is buying Activision for its IP and financial performance varying from the Long-Range Plan outlined at the time of the merger agreement is not an out from the deal. Will Microsoft take a finer look at the contract and begin searching for an excuse to renegotiate the purchase price? I doubt it as Microsoft desperately wants to be viewed as a good actor in the space. Additionally, any reduction in the offer would still likely be above the current Activision share price.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Per Microsoft <a href=\"https://www.nme.com/news/gaming-news/microsoft-very-very-confident-activision-blizzard-merger-will-go-ahead-3316045\" rel=\"nofollow\">CEO Satya Nadella</a> during a September Bloomberg TV interview, âOf course, any acquisition of this size will go through scrutiny, but we feel very, very confident that weâll come outâ.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><a href=\"https://mp1st.com/news/bobby-kotick-activision-expects-microsoft-69b-acquisition-to-push-through-by-june-2023\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bobby Kotick</a> reiterated his view on the transaction with a statement accompanying Activisionâs third quarter results on November 7, 2022, âWe continue to expect that our transaction will close in Microsoftâs current fiscal year ending June 2023.â</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Should this deal break, Activision has cash and investments on its balance sheet of $13.60 per share and Microsoft has agreed to pay a breakup fee of $3.83 per share. Additionally, Activision has an impressive slate of new content including Overwatch 2, Diablo 4, COD Warzone 2, COD Warzone mobile and others. The pre-announcement price is roughly $65 per share. Many investment banks have recently upgraded their stand-alone valuation of Activision to $80-$85 per share. Assuming a drop to $65 per share if the deal breaks due to arb funds indiscriminately selling positions, upside is ~24% and downside is ~15% or roughly 3 to 2.

Those who don’t buy the official explanation think the answer lies in the spy games that played out on Russia’s frontier following the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union. Woodruff was an early actor in a dangerous drama. American spies were moving into newborn nations previously dominated by Soviet intelligence.

Winterbotham</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(77, 77, 77);\">F. W. Winterbotham's The Ultra Secret, which described his role in the breaking and use of the top~secret German code during World War II, was a sensational best seller that made newspaper headlines. In this equally exciting book, Winterbotham reveals his hitherto secret activities as a British spy in the early years of Hitler's Third Reich. Even before the Nazis came to power in the 1930s, Frederick Winterbotham was sent by British Intelligence to Germany to befriend the Nazi leaders and learn as much as he could about their plans. After Hitler took over the government in 1933, he continued his assignment, meeting with Hitler himself, Goering, Rosenberg and a number of generals, visiting military bases, witnessing manoeuvres, and assessing the capabilities of the new German Air Force. Winterbotham played his role so well over the years that the Germans fully accepted him as a loyal friend. He describes how he was recruited for this dangerous job, how he obtained other agents (once carrying $10,000 in a suitcase to pay one of them), what it was like entertaining young German pilots so that they would tell him what he wanted to know, and how he learned which high French officials were on the Nazi payroll. Winterbotham also describes the enormous frustration he sometimes encountered when the British cabinet refused to believe what he told them about the new Stuka dive bomber (they said such a plane was impossible), and the specific German plans for the invasion of Russia outlined to him at dinner one night five years before it was launched. Winterbotham's chronicle is full of anecdotes about agents, double agents and Nazi officials whom he sometimes met in their own homes or with whom he visited at German vacation resorts or political rallies. He describes how he found out about acoustic mines and was able to get photostats of Goering's detailed day book. The result is an absolutely fascinating inside account of a top~level spy at work, a man dealing at the highest levels of international intrigue.</span></p>", "price": 4.0, "date_listed": "2023-03-18T10:24:19.628Z", "creator": 1, "group": null, "visibility": "Public", "listing_type": "Offer (Looking to sell)", "listing_category": "Book", "condition": "Practically new (4/5)", "listing_medium": "Physical Product", "infinite_copies_available": false, "quantity_available": 1, "quantity_sold": 0, "purchasers": []}}, {"model": "market.listing", "pk": 17, "fields": {"title": "MBS: The Rise to Power of Mohammed bin Salman", "image": "listings/images/41imk2BqohL._SX319_BO1204203200_.jpg", "description": "<p>MBS: The Rise to Power of Mohammed bin Salman by Ben Hubbard</p><p><br></p><p><strong>A&nbsp;<em>NEW YORK TIMES&nbsp;</em>EDITORS’&nbsp;CHOICE • A gripping, behind-the-scenes portrait of the rise&nbsp;of Saudi Arabia’s secretive and mercurial new ruler</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>“Revelatory . . . a vivid portrait of how MBS has altered the kingdom during his half-decade of rule.”—<em>The Washington Post</em></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Finalist for the PEN/Jacqueline Bograd Weld Award •&nbsp;ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR:&nbsp;<em>Financial Times, Foreign Affairs, Kirkus Reviews</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p><em>MBS&nbsp;</em>is the untold story of how a mysterious young prince emerged from Saudi Arabia’s sprawling royal family to overhaul the economy and society of the richest country in the Middle East—and gather as much power as possible into his own hands.

The son of two KGB agents and the product of the best Soviet institutions, the savvy, sophisticated Gordievsky grew to see his nation's communism as both criminal and philistine. He took his first posting for Russian intelligence in 1968 and eventually became the Soviet Union's top man in London, but from 1973 on he was secretly working for MI6. For nearly a decade, as the Cold War reached its twilight, Gordievsky helped the West turn the tables on the KGB, exposing Russian spies and helping to foil countless intelligence plots, as the Soviet leadership grew increasingly paranoid at the United States's nuclear first-strike capabilities and brought the world closer to the brink of war. Desperate to keep the circle of trust close, MI6 never revealed Gordievsky's name to its counterparts in the CIA, which in turn grew obsessed with figuring out the identity of Britain's obviously top-level source. Their obsession ultimately doomed Gordievsky: the CIA officer assigned to identify him was none other than Aldrich Ames, the man who would become infamous for secretly spying for the Soviets.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Unfolding the delicious three-way gamesmanship between America, Britain, and the Soviet Union, and culminating in the gripping cinematic beat-by-beat of Gordievsky's nail-biting escape from Moscow in 1985, Ben Macintyre's latest may be his best yet.

As Lee follows the footsteps of a rank and file Nazi official seventy years later, and chronicles what became of him and his family at the war's end, Griesinger's role in Nazi crimes comes into focus. When Lee stumbles on an unforeseen connection between Griesinger and the murder of his own relatives in the Holocaust, he must grapple with potent questions about blame, manipulation, and responsibility.</span></p><p><br></p><p><em style=\"color: rgb(15, 17, 17);\">The S.S.

In time, Christie's surpassed Sotheby's in the international market, as the author demonstrates with graphs appended to the text. But much more intriguing than the factual record are Herbert's exciting, often droll backstage tales of big deals: Christie's team risking death bidding for treasures in Cuba during the Bay of Pigs crisis; a millionaire's wife buying unrestrainedly while her husband is accidentally trapped in the men's room. Herbert colors his account with details of fabulous jewels and other art objects, although such riches fade beside descriptions of the world's greatest paintings.

Herbert's viewpoint as a Christie's loyalist glides from analytical to adoring, while his intimate recollections of estates, specific art works, and auctions are offered in an easy, anecdotal style. The book is British through and through, yet it should appeal to readers for whom the economics of art and the great privately held (then auctioned) collections hold greater sway than the art itself.
